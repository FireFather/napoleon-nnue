## Testing

Whenever a functional change is proposed it is advisable to run a test and provide useful information whether the new build is stronger than master's one.
The following setup is recommended:
* 2400 games
* TC=15"+0.3"
* Any favourite opening book with each opening repeated twice.
* 6 opponents of similar strength (ideally, 3 engines slightly wealer and 3 engines slightly stronger)

It is required to compare the results with a control group specifically ran on your own system, in order to provide meaningful data.
